                            <p>#Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
                            through early and continuous delivery
                            of valuable software.</p>
                            
                            <p>#Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
                            development. Agile processes harness change for 
                            the customer's competitive advantage.</p>
                            
                            <p>#Deliver working software frequently, from a 
                            couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
                            preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
                            
                            <p>#Business people and developers must work 
                            together daily throughout the project.</p>
                            
                            <p>#Build projects around motivated individuals. 
                            Give them the environment and support they need, 
                            and trust them to get the job done.</p>  
                            
                            <p>#The most efficient and effective method of 
                            conveying information to and within a development 
                            team is face-to-face conversation.</p>
